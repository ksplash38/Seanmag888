										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nasal CPAP mask interfaces directly into the nostrils. Side sleepers enjoy this mask type and it works really well with low pressures. This is also a good mask to choose from for patients with facial hair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This nasal CPAP mask is an ideal solution for comfortable long-term use. It has a four-point adjustable headgear for a secure fit that is individually customised to the patient.

The mask is exceptionally simple to fit, with the convenience of cleaning and maintenance. The DeVilbiss Nasal CPAP mask is also available as a full-face mask.</p>
<p>The CPAP Nasal Pillow Mask features ultimate adjustability. The headgear can be adjusted to fit a variety of head sizes and shapes. In addition, the nasal pillows themselves, which come in three varying sizes, are adjustable to guarantee a good fit. The mask features a full 360-degree rotating elbow to allow for patient movement. The pillow is quiet and both intake and exhaust are silent.</p>

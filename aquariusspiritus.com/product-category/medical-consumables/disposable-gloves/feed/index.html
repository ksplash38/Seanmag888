<p>Ultra Feel Nitrile Gloves offer affordable and comfortable protection in all environments.</p>
<p>Nitrile Gloves protect the wearer’s hands. The nitrile material keeps the wears hands safe from any contamination, and it also stop the user from contaminating any item or surface that they are touching. Nitrile is waterproof, greaseproof, oil proof and most importantly, chemical resistant to a range of common chemicals and substances. Nitrile gloves are also commonly used in the medical industry due to their high puncture resistance, and dexterous strength.</p>
<p>Medical Compliance:</p>
<p>TGA Listed Product – This product is listed as a Medical Device Included Class 1</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>Nitrile is a synthetic copolymer, formed through acrylonitrile and butadiene combining.  Nitrile gloves begin their lifecycle as rubber from rubber trees. They are then transformed into latex rubber.  After they are turned into latex rubber, they are again reprocessed until they turn into the nitrile compound material.</p>
<p>The extra processing removes all latex proteins.  The extra step of processing in the glove creation process was originally why when nitrile gloves first hit the market, they were so expensive compared to latex. However, technological advancements have to lead to more cost-effective practices in the making of nitrile gloves.</p>
<p>Nitrile gloves are now just as affordable as latex gloves. The reprocessing and removal of all latex proteins means that nitrile material also has a lower allergy rate than latex.</p>
<p>Nitrile is recommended for all your daily tasks and for those suffering from latex sensitivity. The textured fingers of the glove provide extra protection for wet or dry grip and against slippage.</p>
<p>Nitrile Disposable gloves have a lower allergy rate than latex disposable gloves. Nitrile is the superior choice when it comes to people with allergies or sensitive skin.</p>

<p>Ultra Feel Nitrile Gloves offer affordable and comfortable protection in all environments.</p>
<p>Nitrile Gloves protect the wearer’s hands. The nitrile material keeps the wears hands safe from any contamination, and it also stop the user from contaminating any item or surface that they are touching. Nitrile is waterproof, greaseproof, oil proof and most importantly, chemical resistant to a range of common chemicals and substances. Nitrile gloves are also commonly used in the medical industry due to their high puncture resistance, and dexterous strength.</p>
<p>Medical Compliance:</p>
<p>TGA Listed Product – This product is listed as a Medical Device Included Class 1</p>
<p>General Information:</p>
<p>Nitrile is a synthetic copolymer, formed through acrylonitrile and butadiene combining.  Nitrile gloves begin their lifecycle as rubber from rubber trees. They are then transformed into latex rubber.  After they are turned into latex rubber, they are again reprocessed until they turn into the nitrile compound material.</p>
<p>The extra processing removes all latex proteins.  The extra step of processing in the glove creation process was originally why when nitrile gloves first hit the market, they were so expensive compared to latex. However, technological advancements have to lead to more cost-effective practices in the making of nitrile gloves.</p>
<p>Nitrile gloves are now just as affordable as latex gloves. The reprocessing and removal of all latex proteins means that nitrile material also has a lower allergy rate than latex.</p>
<p>Nitrile is recommended for all your daily tasks and for those suffering from latex sensitivity. The textured fingers of the glove provide extra protection for wet or dry grip and against slippage.</p>
<p>Nitrile Disposable gloves have a lower allergy rate than latex disposable gloves. Nitrile is the superior choice when it comes to people with allergies or sensitive skin.</p>

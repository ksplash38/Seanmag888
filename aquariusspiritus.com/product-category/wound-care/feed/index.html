										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tubigrip Tubular Compression Bandage</p>
<p>Tubigrip provides lasting, effective support with complete freedom of movement. Covered elastic threads within the fabric move to adjust to the contours of the body and distribute pressure evenly over the surface. Fitting is quick and easy. Tubigrip reduces wastage, as only the exact amount required is cut from the roll. Apply with a 2–3cm overlap. If applied as a double layer to the appropriate limb size, Tubigrip will exert 10-15 mm Hg to the limb.</p>
<h4>  Indications</h4>
<p>Tubigrip provides tissue support in the treatment of strains and sprains, soft tissue injuries, general edema, post- burn scarring and ribcage injuries and is also used for pressure dressings and arm fixation.</p>
<h4>Benefits of Tubigrip</h4>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Provides comfortable and effective tissue support</li>
<li>Easy to apply and re-apply</li>
<li>Full range of sizes to suit most applications</li>
<li>No requirements for pins or tape</li>
<li>Washable and reusable</li>
</ul>

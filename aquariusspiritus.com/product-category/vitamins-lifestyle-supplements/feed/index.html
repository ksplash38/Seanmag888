										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great for unwinding after a long day at work or helping to support a normal daily stress response. New MOOD<sup>®</sup> is like a deep breath and a smile in a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supports natural serotonin production<sup>†</sup></li>
<li>Formulated to assist daily mood &amp; relaxation<sup>†</sup></li>
<li>Promotes daily calm<sup>†</sup></li>
<li>Supports a healthy mood balance</li>
</ul>
<p><sup> </sup><strong><em>HOW THIS PRODUCT WORKS</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Serotonin has been shown to be a key neurotransmitter linked to mood, happiness, and positive outlook. Combining the two raw building blocks of serotonin, L-tryptophan and 5-HTP, with a converting catalyst, Vitamin B6, This product provides the nutrients to help the body optimize serotonin levels.<sup>†︎</sup></strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding to the naturally relaxing effects of L-Tryptophan are a host of traditional herbs designed to help you maintain a state of peaceful calm.<sup>†︎</sup>︎ Ideal for when you are under stress, down in the dumps, or just need some refreshing sleep, This product is a great product to take morning, afternoon or night.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR BRAIN WORKS WONDERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>New MOOD works in lockstep with your body to support your body’s normal serotonin production, without artificially introducing it. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>You cannot just take a serotonin supplement and call it a day. Serotonin cannot cross the all-important blood-brain barrier. Serotonin must be produced by the body for you to benefit from it. One of the best ways to do this is to supplement with serotonin’s building blocks. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The natural production of serotonin begins with the common amino acid L-Tryptophan, which converts to 5- HTP — the direct precursor of this essential neurotransmitter. This product contains both L- Tryptophan and 5-HTP, creating an effect that, when combined with the B-vitamins included, assists the body in generating serotonin.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>KEY INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coupled with herbs, these ingredients round out this product’s relaxing formula.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Vitamin B-3 (Niacin)</strong></p>
<p>Common in meat and fish, this B vitamin plays a crucial role in the synthesis of serotonin. <sup>†︎</sup></p>
<p><strong>Vitamin B-6</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Pyridoxine (Vitamin B-6) is one of the body’s busiest vitamins, involved in an estimated 101 chemical reactions. One of its primary tasks is to aid in the manufacturing of amino acids and neurotransmitters, including serotonin.</p>
<p><strong>Magnesium</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Magnesium is needed for hundreds of your body’s basic functions, including supporting your heart and nervous system health, and maintaining blood pressure levels. Supporting a sense of muscular and physical calm, magnesium is commonly used to combat occasional stress and restlessness.<strong><sup> </sup></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tryptophan</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>L-Tryptophan is an essential amino acid found naturally in proteins. It is the building block for 5-HTP, the direct precursor to serotonin. Furthermore, tryptophan is also able to convert to melatonin, which aids sleep.</p>
<p><strong>5-HTP</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The direct precursor and metabolic intermediate of serotonin, 5-HTP is one of the best nutrients to optimize the body’s natural supply of serotonin.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Facts &amp; Use </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Suggested Use: </strong>Adults, as a dietary supplement, take two capsules in the evening prior to sleep. A serving of two capsules may be taken during the day for occasional stress support. Do not exceed six capsules in any 24-hour period.</p>

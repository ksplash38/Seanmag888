<h2>&#8216;Easy Feed&#8217; pillow &#8211; Angled Nursing Pillow</h2>
<div class="product_description">
<p>Dianne King (mother of two) designer, explains her nursing pillow: <em>&#8220;When I breastfed and bottle-fed my first baby, Roslyn, I found it extremely difficult to relax my body while supporting her weight for any length of time. Also, maintaining the correct elevation added to the strain.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I felt that it was probably the same reason why so many other mothers became fatigued in those early months with their new babies. For this reason I designed my breast feeding pillow to alleviate the tension normally associated with feeding.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;After using my pillow with new daughter Michelle, I&#8217;ve found feeding a much more enjoyable and relaxing experience. I think you will enjoy it too.&#8221; </em>Dianne King, Bendigo, Australia.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Easy Feed&#8217; pillow &#8211; Angled Nursing Pillow</h2>
<div class="product_description">
<p>Dianne King (mother of two) designer, explains her nursing pillow: <em>&#8220;When I breastfed and bottle-fed my first baby, Roslyn, I found it extremely difficult to relax my body while supporting her weight for any length of time. Also, maintaining the correct elevation added to the strain.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I felt that it was probably the same reason why so many other mothers became fatigued in those early months with their new babies. For this reason I designed my breast feeding pillow to alleviate the tension normally associated with feeding.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;After using my pillow with new daughter Michelle, I&#8217;ve found feeding a much more enjoyable and relaxing experience. I think you will enjoy it too.&#8221; </em>Dianne King, Bendigo, Australia.</p>

<p>Uniquely crafted, MEDIballs Secret is a Class 1 Medical Device that supports pelvic floor strength and overall pelvic health with an award-winning internal design. Thousands of women have found MEDIballs Secret to be an effective urinary incontinence treatment and stress-free pelvic floor strengthener. MEDIballs is suitable for a woman of any age and ability, the mere presence of the device’s weight starts resistance training, no exercises required. MEDIballs Secret treats and supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevention and treatment of urinary incontinence</li>
<li>Prevention and treatment of minor prolapse</li>
<li>Strengthen vaginal muscles pre and post pregnancy</li>
<li>Strengthen vaginal muscles for sexual health</li>
</ul>
<p>How do MEDIballs work?</p>
<p>MEDIballs use the fastest natural method known to build muscle strength; weight resistance training. This method is referred to as “biofeedback training” a similar concept to strength training in a gym. Within each MEDIball lies an internally located weighted ball, which is triggered into random movements by the natural movement of the body, gently weight training the pelvic muscles.</p>
<p>MEDIballs secret encourages blood flow to the area, rejuvenating and initiating new nerve development. The weight of the MEDIballs may initially feel as though the device is trying to slip out. This is simply the message the muscles send as they work to hold MEDIballs inside. You may wish to start with the MEDIballs Secret Single and then work up to the MEDIballs Secret Double to achieve your personal pelvic health goals.</p>
<p>Safe, Durable &amp; German Made</p>
<p>The exterior of MEDIballs is an easy-to-clean, smooth, BPA plastic and latex-free material. Made from a 100% Silikomed, which is a specially developed thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). MEDIball Secret is a Class 1 Medical Device.</p>

<h2>&#8216;Easy Feed&#8217; pillow &#8211; Angled Nursing Pillow</h2>
<p>Dianne King (mother of two) designer, explains her nursing pillow: <em>&#8220;When I breastfed and bottle-fed my first baby, Roslyn, I found it extremely difficult to relax my body while supporting her weight for any length of time. Also, maintaining the correct elevation added to the strain.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I felt that it was probably the same reason why so many other mothers became fatigued in those early months with their new babies. For this reason I designed my breast feeding pillow to alleviate the tension normally associated with feeding.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;After using my pillow with new daughter Michelle, I&#8217;ve found feeding a much more enjoyable and relaxing experience. I think you will enjoy it too.&#8221; </em>Dianne King, Bendigo, Australia.</p>
